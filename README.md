This is a repo to store my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems. I've been working
through them in order for a while, whenever I get the chance and I'm feeling
bored.

Many of my solutions are sub-optimal, but none run over the recommended 1 minute
limit. (95% take less than a second, and the rest are pretty much in the 1-20 second range).

All solutions are writtien in Java, and I reuse a lot of snippets (for primality testing,
GCD, sorting, etc).
