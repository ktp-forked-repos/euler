# Project Euler
This is a repo to store my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems. I've been working
through them in order for a while, whenever I get the chance and I'm feeling
bored. Many of my solutions are sub-optimal, but all solutions obey the 1-minute rule.
Most of my solutions are written in Java, but recently I've been using Python.

I have no friends... Add me! Project Euler Friend Key: 828335_247ff2ce1fbeefab8bb444e1f2b414f5
